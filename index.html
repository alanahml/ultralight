        Lately I've been thinking about how timefulness is a reverse function of how long I am on the internet in that neither do I feel clearer or see clearer the more I'm online. It's like i'm on-----line, there's a deadspace that comes with <i>browsing browsing browsing browsing 
            browsing browsing browsing browsing
            browsing browsing browsing browsing
            browsing browsing browsing browsing
            browsing browsing browsing browsing
        </i> I'm seeking with no end it feels like a gluttonous consumption of hypermedia
